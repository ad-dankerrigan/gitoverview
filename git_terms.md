# Understanding Git Terminology

An explanation of common Git terminology.

## Version Control System

A version control system (VCS) is a tool that helps developers track and manage changes to their code over time. Git is a popular distributed version control system.

## Repository

A repository, often referred to as a "repo," is a storage location for a project's files and version history. Git repositories contain all the project's files, commits, branches, and more.

## Branch

A branch is a parallel line of development within a Git repository. It allows developers to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Branches can be created, switched between, merged, or deleted.

## Staging

Staging, also known as the "index," is the step where you prepare changes for a commit. You select which changes should be included in the next commit by adding them to the staging area using the `git add` command.

## Commit

A commit is a snapshot of the changes you've made to your project at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and is accompanied by a commit message that describes the changes. Commits are the building blocks of your project's version history.

## Push

Pushing refers to uploading your local commits to a remote repository, typically hosted on a Git server like GitHub or GitLab. This action shares your changes with others and keeps the remote repository up-to-date.

## Status

The `git status` command is used to check the current state of your working directory and staged changes. It provides information about untracked files, changes to be committed, and changes not staged for commit.

## Log

The `git log` command displays a chronological list of commits in the project's history. It shows information such as the commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

## Merging

Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. It is typically used to integrate new features or bug fixes into the main development branch.

## Rebase

Rebasing is an alternative to merging that rewrites the commit history by moving or combining commits from one branch onto another. It can result in a cleaner, more linear history.

## Pull

The `git pull` command updates your local repository with changes from a remote repository. It combines the `git fetch` and `git merge` steps in one command.

## Configuration

Configuring Git involves setting your username and email address, which are associated with your commits. This information is used to identify the author of each commit.

## Help

The `git help` command is used to access Git's built-in documentation for a specific Git command. For example, you can run `git help commit` to get information about the `commit` command.

Understanding these Git terms will help you navigate the version control system more effectively and use the Git cheat sheet with confidence.
